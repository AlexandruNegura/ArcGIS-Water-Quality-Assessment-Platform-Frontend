## How to run
The website must be run as a server for security and Cross-Origins related problems. To run the website, first we need the following packages:
- npm install -g gulp-server-livereload
- npm install -g http-server

After the packages are installed:
- If you want to automatically see the changes while working, run `livereload` in the main folder and then access `http://localhost:8000`
- If you just want to test the website, with no reloads, run `http-server -p 8000 .` in the main folder and then access `http://localhost:8000`
